# Transparent Reporting of Ethics for Generative AI: the TREGAI Checklist

The widespread use of ChatGPT and other emerging technology powered by generative artificial intelligence (AI) has drawn much attention to potential ethical issues, especially in high-stakes applications such as healthcare. However, less clear is how to resolve such issues beyond following guidelines and regulations that are still under discussion and development. On the other hand, other types of generative AI have been used to synthesize images and other types of data for research and practical purposes, which have resolved some ethical issues and exposed other ethical issues, but such technology is less often the focus of ongoing ethical discussions. Here we highlight gaps in current ethical discussions of generative AI via a systematic scoping review of relevant existing research in healthcare, and reduce the gaps by proposing an ethics checklist for comprehensive assessment and transparent documentation of ethical discussions in generative AI development. While the checklist can be readily integrated into the current peer review and publication system to enhance generative AI research, it may also be used in broader settings to disclose ethics-related considerations in generative AI-powered products (or real-life applications of such products) to help users establish reasonable trust in their capabilities.

- *We strongly recommend reading this checklist in conjunction with the reference article above for important clarifications on all the items.*
- We will update the checklist when there are updated ethical principles, recommended actions, or progresses in generative AI regulations and guidelines. 

The TREGAI checklist is provided to systematically document ethical assessments in development or applications of generative AI, specifically:

- identification of ethical **issues caused**, or **mitigation** of existing issues, 
- any **solutions** to issues identified, or **inadequacies** of mitigation methods,
- **explicit document** relevant elaboration and justification, and
- **involvement of ethicists** in ethics discussion and review process. 

The checklist is applicable for:

- Generative AI research: to facilitate in-depth discussion during peer review and after publication.
- Generative AI-powered products: to disclose ethics-related considerations and measures to help users establish reasonable trust.
- Generative AI-created contents (e.g., on social media or in education): to disclose benefits, limitations and potential risks on relevant ethical aspects.
